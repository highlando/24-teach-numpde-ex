# A11 Modelling

Derive the heat equation (without source or sink)

\begin{equation}
\partial_t u(t,x) - \alpha \Delta_x u(t,x) = 0
\end{equation}

that describes the evolution of a temperature $u$ inside a domain (assume a homogeneous piece of material) at a time $t$.
It is definitely OK to consult Wikipedia for that, just make sure you can
explain the mechanisms.

What are *physical boundary* conditions? How are they stated mathematical? Terms
to consider are *convective*, *adiabatic*, *heat-flux* (or, from the mathematical
side, *Dirichlet*, *Neumann*, *Robin*).

# A12 Analytic Solutions

1. Find an analytic solution to the 2D-Poisson/Dirichlet problem
\begin{align}
-\Delta u(x) &= 1, \quad x\in \Omega=\mathcal B_{(0,1)}:=\{x\in \mathbb R^{2}\colon \|x\| _ 2<1\}, \\
u\bigl| _ {\partial \Omega} &= 0.
\end{align}
Can you find a solution to the same problem with $\Omega$ being the unit-square
instead and why possibly not?

2. Show that for space dimension $d$, i.e. $x\in \mathbb R^{d}$, the function
\begin{equation}
h(t, x) =
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{(4\pi t)^{\frac {d}{2}}} e^{-\frac{\|x\| _ 2^2}{4t}}, \quad &t>0\\
0 \quad &t\leq 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
  * satisfies the heat equation $\partial _ t h - \Delta_x h=0$ on $\mathbb R^{n}$
and 
  * that $\int_{\mathbb R^{n}} h(t,x) dx=1$.

It is OK to set $d=1$ for the calculations and you may want to use the
substitution $\tilde x = \frac{x}{2\sqrt t}$ to show the integral equality.

3. Show that $u(t, x) = f(x-ct)$ solves the 1D transport equation (i.e. $d=1$)
\begin{align}
\partial_t u(t, x) + c\partial_xu(t,x) &= 0, \quad x\in \mathbb R^{},\quad t>0 \\
u\bigl| _ {t=0}(x) &= f(x)
\end{align}
for some differentiable function $f\colon \mathbb R^{}\to \mathbb R^{}$.

# A13 Classification

PDEs are typically classified as *elliptic*, *parabolic*, or *hyperbolic*. As we
have learned it in the lecture, a second order linear homogeneous PDE is
classified according to the coefficients of the leading terms. However, the
underlying principle is about how information is transported (in space or time).
This means, e.g., if and how the value of $u(t_0, x_0)$ will affect the value
$u(t_1, x_1)$ at a different time and a different location.

1. Use the explicit solution of the transport equation above to make a point that transport equations are hyperbolic (i.e. information is only transferred along certain paths in space-time).
2. One can show that with the fundamental solution $h$ of the heat-equation as
   above, the solution that respects an initial condition $u\bigl | _ {t=0}(x) =
   u_0(x)$ is defined as
   \begin{equation}
   u(t,x) = \int_{\mathbf R^d}h(t, x-\xi)u_0(\xi) d\xi,
   \end{equation}
   with $h$ as defined in **A12**.
   Use this expression to make a point about the parabolic nature of the heat
   equation, namely that information is transferred immediately in time across the full space.

# A14 Nabla Calculus

Use the *nabla* operator in its formal vector representation $\nabla =
(\partial_1, \dotsc, \partial_d)$ to express the Laplace operator, the divergence, and (for $d=3$) the curl operator. 
Is the *nabla* rather a row or a column vector? (There is no clear answer to
that, but you should think about it once).
